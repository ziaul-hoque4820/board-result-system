# Board Result System: A Modern Approach to Result Management 👨‍🎓

## Project Overview 💡
Welcome to the **Board Result System**! This project is a streamlined, interactive clone of our country's official SSC/HSC result portal. It's designed to showcase a modern approach to managing and displaying student results using **local browser storage**. We've created a dynamic system that allows you to add, edit, and delete mock student data, then search for and view a complete result sheet.

Since there's no real student data involved, the system uses **locally stored mock data**, giving you a safe environment to explore its functionalities. This means you have full control!

***Before you search for a result, remember to create student data first!***
