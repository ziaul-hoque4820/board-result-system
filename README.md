# Board Result System

## Project Overview
The **Board Result System** is a clone project inspired by the official SSC/HSC result viewing website in our country. It simulates the process of checking board exam results using locally stored student data. Since no real student data is available, mock data is created and stored in the browser's local storage. Users can add, edit, update, or delete student data, and when a user searches for a result, the system will show the full result sheet if a matching record is found. Otherwise, it will display an alert saying "Data not matched".

### Important Note
Before searching for results, **you must create student data first**.  
- Without creating data, the result search will not work.  
- After adding student data, you can search using the given student information.  

Users can add, edit, update, or delete student data from the admin section.

## Features
